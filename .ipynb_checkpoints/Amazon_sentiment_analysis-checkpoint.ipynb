I'll highly recommend you to try this, if you didn't prefer just milk and sugar in a chocolate. The 50% dark chocolate really gives an internal pleasure, when you consume it. And, it feels like it's just more than consuming a chocolate. On the more,  the Cranberries in it gives it a weird but enjoyable taste, and makes it a healthy one. Finally, comparing different Cadbury ranges,  I've found its the one and only product from Cadbury, which is free from trans fatty acids . That's really a good news for the health conscious. So, what are you waiting for? Just grab it.\\n\\n\",\n",
