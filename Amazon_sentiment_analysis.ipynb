       " '\\n\\n  The best camera with the following features- AI support for person detection- best image clarity on low light and night- easy to setup- Alexa and google assistant support- High built quality- Make in India product- Cloud storage and SD card storage support- Nice packaging- Less power consumption- Comparable with nest, arlo, ring and wyze cameras- Faster software updates with features However, Qubo is a fantastic one!It could make the camera superior if increase efficiency on AI person detection, desktop live grid view apps, local storage support(NAS/NVR), fixed mount option or 1/4” thread 0.5 mm screw thread, optional power adapter to connect directly to electricity supply as in qubo video doorbell, administrative password to camera settings like routers( as multiple logins are supported) or share camera view.\\n\\n',\n",
       " '\\n\\n  This product is awesome. The build quality looks premium and sturdy. And it is power packed with features as they have mentioned. Really liked the motion tracking feature and person detection feature. One thing which is unique and important is the preset feature through which I had defined some zones and with one tap it automatically rotates to that particular angle with the Qubo App.One thing which they can improve on is the camera movement during motion tracking. If I am moving really fast then it loses the track after one point. Although it is understandable since the camera movement is limited. Anyways gud job Qubo. 👍\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  I am writing this review after using this product for 1 month .Pros : Elegant  and compact Design ,Finishing is good ,packing is good .Cons : Onboard Software Glitch , Latency issue , Mobile app software not up to the mark .( sometimes Hangs ).Issues I have faced in One month :Issue 1:I had received this product in good condition ,Upon using I found that the 64 GB class 10 memory card is not detecting ,I reformatted it to FAT 32 but still dint work. I called the CC and asked for an replacement ( Thinking its and defective product ) ,Product was replaced in 3 days . Same issue occurred in the replaced product. I called up the CC ,they said they will update the SW ,still dint work and the issue is pending .Later I inserted 16 GB Memory card and its working now with max 16 GB card or may be upto 32 GB . - So the claim on upto 256 GB memory card support  is Technically wrong .The same 64 GB card is working with my 3 year old cam for which i paid 1700.( Non qubo Brand )Issue 2 : The person tracking feature works well only when the cam is in desktop or in normal position . But when I mounted it in ceiling and enabled Rotate Image ,the tracking dint work as expected ,It tracked at the initial moment and turned to an corner where there is no person moment at all . Called up the CC ,but the same answer .issue not resolved .Issue 3 :1.Mobile software hangs some time ,need to kill the app and reopen .2. latency issue while streaming the video( Image Pixelating ) ,this happens sometimes - CC's resolution is to reboot Internet router . But that's not the fix for the issue .I have called up Customer Care Several time ,but the issues have not resolved and the ticket has been closed , I can provide the CC ticket reference number and call recording also .Recommendation to the Buyer :  I taught this is an made in India Initiative product and purchased it ,but now i regret it . Please do not invest your money in this product and waste your Time and money .I am not going to escalate this issue to the CEO of Qubo or any other authority as its not worth spending my time on it and for the value of the product .Please invest on much more mature product if you need better result .Thanks\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Nice product Fulfilling your expectations. Picture and night  views are clear. Coloured picture even in night mode/dim light. Very easy to install. I faced a bit problem previously with motion sensor but has been resolved by customer care. Customer care response is nice. Ugly part is about fixing of cam on roof. Two holes in the lower part needs lot of precision. My suggestion to the company is either to modify the system or to change the system. Sturdy and heavy base unlike other cams online. Its really indian. Overall a nice product worth your money\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  **UPDATE 08/01/22**Received a replacement from Qubo. Installed Cam and looks ok as of now. More than the product, their service is good. Good follow up for replacement.**Old Review**Product worked fine only for a 2 days. Picture has become hazy and whenever we rotate the camera half picture becomes messy and look like all colours are leaking (photo attached). Voice from camera to your phone also is very bad. Third day, there is burning smell from adaptor and the adaptor is gone. Can't return, My installation was late, Just out of the return window. Don't know what to do.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  Bought it recently have been using it for a day and checked the complete cycle for a day. Below are the list of pros, cons and important points to consider before purchasing to help you make a decision:Written on: 22nd December 2021Pros:* Initial configuration is easy* App is stable - checked on both Android and IOS* App's camera config is easy to use - can easily access and control cam and change viewing direction etc.* You can configure multiple cameras in app* Live feed is stable (depending on network)* Mounting on ceiling is not necessary you can place it anywhere stable.* Mounting screws with wall plugs/nylon sleeves are provided if needed* Both Day and Night mode picture/video feed is good* Expendable storage of up to 256GB using micro sd cardCons:* In default plan(free) you can only connect to 2 mobile phones at a time, and you have to share credentials of app on another phone/device to see the feed.* Right now it is not possible for two different app logins to connect to a single Qubo device.* If you need access on more than 2 mobile devices then you would have to subscribe (paid and ongoing) to one of the listed plans. (prices are reasonable for now)* Event tracking is not 100% accurate, so you will get false notifications at times* App could be better - for example:  ** right now if you try to disable cloud storage it shows that functionality can only be disabled after purchasing a subscription.  ** Ideally it should be user's choice whether they want to store on cloud or not.  ** gallery functionality is not clear  ** not able to manually record a video, and error which is shown is not helpful.Important Points to Consider before buying:* Camera needs  a home network in 2.4Ghz band (wifi)* Uninterrupted power supply is needed* Power cable provided is approximately 150cm in length so depending on where you're mounting/placing the camera you would need an extension or power outlet nearby.Overall:Product is highly recommended, the cons listed are not a deal breaker as most people will not use the listed features, and will only need feed on at most 2 devices which is free.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Absolute waste of money and time!My camera stopped working after a month and their customer support is very pathetic. I've been talking to them for about 10 days now but they make one excuse or another every day. After 10 days of talking neither the camera has been fixed, replaced or money refunded.Pros:-noneCons:-1) Very poor customer and non-proactive support.2) No offline mode. Goes dead and all functions stop if wifi is not available.3) Does not give color image at night time so don't be fooled by color image in low light claim.4) Very poor motion and person detection. Fails more than 50% of the time5) Requires you to keep your router firewall on low setting otherwise it goes into offline mode.6) Can't work with a hidden wifi SSID even after you first configure it and hide it later.7) sometimes its infrared stops working and everything goes dark at night time. You only see the light bulbs and everything is just black and sometimes magenta. This happens after it has been offline for 10-12 hours.8) No desktop or browser application available to track cameras using your desktop or TV screen.9) Mobile application is power hungry and will drain your battery if you keep it on.10) You can't set schedules to start and end recording automatically at specified time or day considering motion detection is almost useless here.11) Can't set any activity or inactivity zones to improve the motion detection.\\n\\n\",\n",

It does not record live video on to SD card. Only records motion captures or events of ~4 seconds3. Then you will get a notification, Assumption is that you will have to getup in the middle of the sleep (or) whatever the state you were in, open their app and press the record button. (this is the way, from at least as far as I could understand their app)4. App is so confusing., slow.5. No return. Only replacement., Why would anyone sane want a replacement? :|Pros:build quality.\\n\\n',\n",

All necessary accessories come in the package, even small paper sticker helping to drill holes.Clarity of the image is really clear. Wide coverage area.  Camera can be rotated 360 degree horizontal and about 10 deg down + 90 degree top.Surprising is, even if there is little bit of lighting, camera gives clear colour images m (the image shows the picture taken at 9:30 p.m. with 3 watt LED indirect lighting).The app has replay feature from SD card, but without fast forwarding, which is one of the most important feature missing.

       " \"\\n\\n  I was looking for an Indoor Wifi Camera, for my children's room as was much concerned about safety when was away from home due to work. After many surveys finalized this product, It is giving an excellent performance, 1080p video quality is best in class, Accurately detect the motion and gives a direct notification to your phone even if the app is not open, which helps me to monitor much effectively. Have installed the camera on the ceiling in the center of the room, accurately follow the motion of kids with no blind areas in the room. Two-way talk facilitates me to communicate in the room and gives clear audio with good volume on both the side. storage is not an issue at all, will support up to 256GB of micro SD card(Needs to be purchased separately) also comes with a LAN port in case if you need more storage.  one touch privacy protection that closes the shutter physically is the cherry on a pie.Would definitely suggest going for it without any further thinking. Works outstandingly well, best for indoor use.\\n\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n\\n  Poor Video Quality as after connecting to NVR the highest resolution option I am getting is 680x340 which is VGA resolution and Dahua Customer support is pathetic, they themselves are not aware of how the camera gets connected to NVR.Video quality from IMOU Life app is HD which is okay but not Full HD for sure as I have other cameras which are Full HD & has better video quality but it’s okay as long as you only want to use it to record video stream using either SD-Card or Cloud Storage.Two way audio quality is not that effective as you can’t hear other people clearly due to camera speaker not being that loud and you won’t find any option to increase volume.Another problem is that when you share the device with family members they can only initiate two way audio when they are allowed full control of device which is weird as they should update the IMOU life software to have different user roles to allow two-way communications including video viewing.Motion sensor needs to improve a bit, it’s good but not good enough to serve the purpose. Overall okay to have this camera if you just want to try first security camera to start with and have reasonable budget.Dahua need to improve the product quality for sure and if they are reading then please take these comments as good feedback as it’s not that bad product which I can’t recommend, small enhancements will improve customers experience and will make it a wow product.\\n\\n',\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  Remember... nothing is perfect. Xiaomi has already released home security cameras using other brands such as Yi. And the home security camera market is yet to be adapted in large. So, you can expect a lot of misunderstanding on how everything works together in a home security camera in general.Initial setup: It is a breeze for some, but pain for others. See the 1-star ratings if you want proof. I had trouble getting this camera recognized by its own app (Mi Home). It took about 1 hour to recognize after trying with different lighting conditions. The camera got disconnected from the app, after I switched the SSID of the router. So, I had to pair it again. This time, it took more than a day(!) of trial and error. I had to keep the camera under bright sun light in order to get recognized by the Mi Home app. Lesson learned in a hard way.Bandwidth requirement: This camera requires 24x7 connectivity with solid internet connection and with good upload bandwidth. Even if you have 100mbps connection, this camera can only be connected via wireless. So, longer the distance from the router, shorter the bandwidth. This camera hangs up, if it doesn't have enough bandwidth. If you add NAS storage, you'd need even more bandwidth between the camera and the router. The camera is very sensitive. If you set up any conflicting configurations, it'd just hang and would not record anything at all, even in the on-board SD card storage. If the camera hangs for a particular reason, you have to restart it. It is a pain to troubleshoot things when you are miles away from home in another city.Mi Home app requires almost all the permissions from your phone. But, I was able to disable most permissions except location and storage. What's more! You get ads in the app right after opening it (on the dashboard where you see the list of devices) since version 5.4.43 (released on Dec 26, 2018). I wish Xiaomi released a dedicated app for home security cameras, like other companies have done.Google Assistance isn't compatible with this camera, if you are into that sort of thing. Some other cameras from Xiaomi (not released in India) are supported, though.Once paired to the app and once you have the perfect setup (with NAS and good wireless bandwidth to / from the camera), you may become addicted to use it under different conditions, such as with total darkness.If you are technically sound and have around 10k budget, Raspberry Pi based home security is a better option! If you are on a budget and if you don't want to spend a lot of time on technical things, then, Xiaomi Mi Home Security Camera is the best home monitoring camera you can get!\\n\\n\",\n",

You are really lucky if this camera can read QR code in your phone during setup. I spend a whole day and no luck. Then , after google, I realised that this is a known issue.

       " '\\n\\n  Purchased on 5.09.18 for Rs 3999/- in lightning deal [ Colour Cobalt Blue] .Delivered 11.09.18. Camera used for the first time on 17.09.18 on Vishwakarma Puja. Films  and camera case purchased separately from market and are cheaper than online rate . Camera is made in Thailand .Camera has functioned well so far , however, the battery cover has become loose within 3days. I am a novice in normal photogaphy ( i.e., I use only point & shoot cameras as in mobile phones). Some reviewers have described Fuji Instax Mini as a toy but I do not agree with them. If you like experimenting with photography ,you should try this. If you like something just for fun then too try this.Instant camera means you have just one chance. The photo may be good or bad depending how you handle it.But this process is immensely satisfying as you strive to improve. The camera comes with good instruction sheet. Read it carefully. Also watch online instruction videos - just Google Fuji Instax Mini 9 & you will come across several. They will show you in detail how to load battery, films and start taking photos. I watched these films before I took the first photo & it came out quite nicely. The camera suggests lightning and I strongly recommend that you follow it, until you become an expert in instant photography. The charm is to see you photos develop instantly and the pleasure of taking autograph on spot (if you take a photo of someone you admire) or presenting a photo to someone.Load film cartridge exactly as given in instructions .Open foil preferably in dimly lighted room, slip cartridge inside(see videos ), then press the shutter. A film cover will pop out. the camera will show that 10 films are loaded. Now it is ready to use. As you take photos, the camera will indicate how many films left.A photo takes about 3 minutes to develop fully. DO NOT SHAKE THE PHOTO. Just put it gently on a flat surface, away from strong light. After 3 mins, show it to everyone. Store photos in albums.Use the close-up lens to get good photos. Distance should be between 35 -50cm, not more. Without lens it should be 60cm to 2.5m. Instant photography is not for people in a hurry. Films are expensive, so you have to be patient when you take photos. Some times  better results come  for the photographer to sit down & take instant photo. I took the first photo sitting on a bench. I have not yet taken a selfie so I cant comment on that aspect. The photos are small in size like an ATM card.So you should plan what photos to take. If for eg you take full figure the person photographed will look tiny. In my childhood days of black & white photography with non-digital film cameras or box camera as they were called,  small square photos used to be developed. The photos in the instax mini are about that type (though not square). If you have old black & white photos at home, it will give you an idea about size of the subject in photos.I initially wanted to own this camera because of its colours. I followed Amazon pricing for more than one year, before I plunged in the lightning deal. I took the decision to buy it recently,after someone took my instant photo( in a more expensive camera) & presented it to me.  Fuji instax mini is the cheapest among instant cameras.  Try it and you will get addicted.\\n\\n',\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  Instax Mini 8 was one of the favourite fun camera for instant photo lovers and while keeping its popularity in mind Fujifilm has now launched this new Instax Mini 9 with some minor upgrades. Unlike other countries, Instax Mini 8 in the Indian market was not a successful attempt due to less popularity for Instant cameras, to turn the tables Fujifilm has now come up with its updated version equipped with a selfie mirror and few minor upgrades. Let’s get into details:In the Box:----------------1. Camera2. Two AA non rechargeable batteries3. Strap4. Close-up lens5. Few Manuals, sticker and warranty card.Design:-------------The unique retro design with attractive pastel shades is one of the major reason people love this camera more than any other instant camera. Fujifilm while keeping the retro look intact, has now renewed its colour range with cool colours like Cobalt blue, Lime green, Ice blue, Flamingo pink and Smokey white. It weighs just around 350 grams with battery and it measures 4.56 x 4.66 x 2.69 inch, also it’s built up with plastic and that's make it look like a toy camera.Few improvements in design includes a tiny selfie mirror at front of the camera to lure all those selfie lovers out there and a close up lens attachment to help capture macro shots more precisely.Hardware:---------------This camera features a 60 mm lens with f/12.7 aperture and a flash that always light up whether you are indoor or outdoor. It also houses a light sensor that helps to automatically adjust the exposure as per the lighting condition and we only need to turn the dial as per the indicator. There is a dedicated high key mode which is an addition in this model to maximize brightness.It comes with a set of two AA batteries but instead of these I would recommend to use rechargeable batteries that you’ll need to buy separately to save some bucks. There’s also a photo count analogue meter at the back that counts the number of shots remaining.Performance:-------------------This camera is just for fun and is not meant to click ultra HD pictures like DSLR’s so better not compare it to them. It’s an instant camera so don’t expect any kind of connectivity with any other device. If you want a fun camera then only buy it or else you’ll regret.Just press the power button located near the lens to turn on the camera and the lens will pop up. Adjust the exposure by using rotating the dial to the desired position as suggested by the light sensor and that’s it you’re ready to click  retro looking pics, after clicking the photo the camera will extract a photo print from top of the camera in 2-3 seconds.Don’t get shocked by viewing a blank picture because photo will take a minute or two to get fully developed.But to use it you will have to first buy a photo cartridge which is available in the market separately at not so pocket friendly price and after putting the cartridge in the camera you will be able to click just 10 pictures before inserting a new cartridge.Verdict:--------------Overall, the look and feel of this camera is just like a toy with no sharp edges and eye soothing colour, also the process of clicking photos is really simple but the cost per photo is not economical as per my opinion but that’s not what everyone seeks who buy this camera since it’s just for fun.If you have a good budget to spend on an Instant camera then there are many options out there with better clarity and larger photo capabilities.P.S.

       " \"\\n\\n  I have a mi security camera already and I am using it since one year. After the lockdown, it went out of stock but soon arrived at Amazon but it's cost had increased. Even then I went ahead and tried to purchase it as I had prior confidence but just before buying Amazon showed me a feature comparison with this camera (tapo c200). So my review would be largely a comparison of the two with a breakup of the features of both security cameras.On the feature front, this tapo camera beats mi security camera hands down. It comes with home monitoring, call/talk back feature just as mi security camera but additionally has privacy feature to switch off recording, alarm on/off on detection of movement, clean user interface, advanced self diagnosis feature, auto reboot feature and 128gb sdcard storage as against no privacy feature and 64gb in mi security camera. Also on detection of movement, mi security camera records multiple clips of max 1 min duration whereas tapo doesn't have that recording constraint. This is the biggest disadvantage of mi security camera. The setup took time as my WiFi was hidden and camera didn't recognize the hidden network even though I manually added it. But finally to overcome that, I made my WiFi network discoverable, once tapo recognized and stored it, I once again hid my WiFi and tapo didn't have any problem.Aesthetics of tapo are however not that good as mi security camera. mi security camera feels premium when touched physically. However when you touch tapo, you get a cheap Chinese feeling which I hated when I opened the box. Moreover tapo rotates from its bottom and the rotating diameter is large. Mi security camera rotates from its middle point and the rotating diameter is consequently smaller.Other than the rotating and aesthetics, tapo wins quite handsomely. If you want a premium feeling ( which no longer matters once the camera is setup) go for mi security camera otherwise go for tapo c200 and enjoy the rich features at a lesser price.Will update more about its longevity in future.Update1: After 3 months I realized that after inserting SD card, the initialisation time has increased by more than two minutes whereas in mi camera, the initialisation time hasn't noticeably changed. So mi camera wins here.Update 2: Recording and browsing of recording in sd card in tapo is better but when tapo records any video on detection of any Movement, the green light of the camera turns to red. Also when night mode switches on, one can hear the relay sound from tapo easily. Mi camera continues to emit blue light even while recording and no relay sound comes out of Mi camera when night mode switches on. So Mi camera wins here again.Update 3: in case of motion detection, mi camera takes an estimated 8-9 minutes to process the feed and send you a notification. That is, if a person/motion is detected at 8:00pm in front of camera, you will receive a notification only at 8:09 pm. In case of tapo, this is 4-5 minutes with a buzzer/alarm feature. Here Tapo wins down handsomely.More updates in future\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  This is really a very good Camera in this price. Beleive me I have tried all the Xiaomi, Yi and D3D Smart Wifi Cams and this I found one of the best option.I am using these with Home Assistant and MotionEYE.I have not inserted any SD card and using MotionEYE to directly record videos to my system.The RTSP stream is in full hd 1080p and its really good. It loads instantly and delay is of few microseconds.I am using 1080p feed over RTSP and 360p feed on the app so both the things can be used at the same time.I have configured AI Face recognition using this camera to announce whoever is on my gate over my Google Home Mini and this is working really well with this cam.Pros:- Good Video Quality at 1080p and at Night- Really loud speaker- Camera Speaker can be used to trigger alarm sound- They offer RTSP/ONVIF support for these camera which is a big deal- Fast and Responsive App- Ability to live view camera feed on any computer systemCons:Sometimes connectivity issue in the app but it can be fixed with the update.No NAS support like Xiaomi Cameras, However I don't need it as RTSP is more then enough but having NAS support in app is a big bonus.\\n\\n\",\n",

It provides 360' degree tilting from left to right and vice versa, also up and down view is available.2) Clarity provides 1080 pixel, which you can't get in normal security camera especially at this budget(2500rs).3) It doesn't record the idle position, and captures any small movements. It only records if there is a movement, which is a good feature. Also it provides constant notification for every movement. Even it is a small flies it captures that too and sends the notification to mobile.4) You just need a wifi and power point.5) Draw back is if someone steals the camera, then you can't see anything, because everything is recorder in camera's sd card.Even if you switch off or it doesn't get wifi you can't view or download anything.6) if you are placing this inside the gate then it is a good option.7) another feature is it also records the voice.8) I inserted 128 gb sd card on this.My review is 5/5\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Update 2: 3rd Oct 2021Cameras have got one or two firmware updates so far. Things have got better quite a bit now.Playback from app has improved.I am satisfied.I have installed the cameras on the walls outside. Away from direct sunlight and rain though. Covered openings with tape to prevent dust and moisture getting in.A year in, so far everything is fine.Update 1: The Tapo app absolutely sucks. Terrible app. Sometimes takes one or two minutes to get video from camera. Viewing recorded video footage is equally painful. You have to play the entire lenght of the video to record. Ridiculous! No option to simply get files from camera. Even trying to change camera settings is lethargic.----I will compare this camera with Mi Camera which I also own.C100 supports ONVIF and RTSP. It makes the camera versatile. You can connect it with software/hardware NVRs. I hooked it up with MotionEyeOS running on a Raspberry Pi.This was the reason why I bought this camera.You can see all RTSP/ONVIF IP cameras in grid view from a computer/Android TV.Mi cameras don't have ONVIF/RTSP support.Mi camera can only be viewed from a phone app. (And chromecast+google displays which most people don't have.)No PC software or even an Android TV app for Mi camera.You can connect it to a NAS where camera automatically uploads original recordings periodically. Tapo cameras don't have this. (You can create a NAS from your PC/RaspberryPi etc.)Tapo C100 over-saturates colors. Too much.Mi camera does it too but not that bad.Field of View of C100 is narrower than Mi camera.When Night Vision (infrared lights) is on in Tapo, three red LEDs can be seen with naked eye. It does not have invisible LED infrared. It makes the camera visible, which is bad.Tapo camera has two hooks on bottom to wall mount. Mi camera doesn't.Google assistant support is there for both cameras. You can cast camera to google home display/Chromecast ultra device.Build quality of Mi camera is better than Tapo C100.If you are only going to use a phone app to view the camera, get the Mi camera.If you need to see cameras on laptop, get Tapo.In case, in future Mi cameras get RTSP/ONVIF support, no doubt get Mi.\\n\\n\",\n",

The other two units worked flawlessly without any issues I faced with night mode. TP-Link's Tapo app was good with a clean UI with ability to view upto 32 cameras just like a cctv system.Pros:Easy setup, 128Gb storage, No SD errors like problems i faced in Mi cameras. Ability to connect the cameras to a NVR system as ONVIF protocol IP cameras.I added these cameras to my Synology DiskStation NAS system that has amazing surveillance station software that can beat any NVR systems available in india.Motion detection was too sensitive, had to reduce the sensitivity & muted the notifications on the phone.These are really good stable performing cameras. I can say these are very reliable for use as IP cameras.I'm currently using six Tapo C100 Cameras. No issues faced except for my first order.

       " \"\\n\\n  In fact let me confess that I have been using all sorts of cameras , point and shoot, travel, high zoom, DSLR s for well over two decades. And as a compulsive camera buyer, i buy cameras without any rhyme or reason. So far I have been using either Canon or Nikon, but this time I decided to go for Sony.......Recently my small canon point and shoot I had gifted to my friend and hence decided to go for Sony. I chanced upon SONY DCS W830 . I bought the camera on Amazon with very high hopes about the picture quality,ease of use,good optics, but frankly I am disappointed on following points about the camera. The delivery by Amazon is world-Class, super fast and with very good service.Build quality is not up to the mark. you can feel it.  The top plate on the camera which houses shutter and on-off button is very loose.  My one day old camera is already showing that this plate may fall off anytime. Secondly , the buttons are so flush on the top plate that even before you struggle to find the button, it operates without you feeling it lock the focus. Even on-off button needs some effort to locate and switch on. In any camera half press shutter locks the focus This Camera locks the focus but even a slightly more pressure. on shutter releases the shutter, causing out of focus pics.Picture quality initially looks good. But I may have to shoot under different conditions to verify that whether the picture quality is in keeping with SONY Quality. Which I believe is top class . Just now I downloaded few pics shot on this camera, and I found them to be of average quality.I bought the camera for its Zeiss Lens, Sony's famous software, and the name sony is a guarantee in itself. I very well know that this particular camera is 5 year old model. and Sony may no longer be manufacturing this model, but if these are the deficiencies which persist, then why Sony is still market ting it. It may have adverse impact.I also feel that one has to find out whether the product is genuine Sony or some sub-standard stuff is being palmed off as genuine sony product.I will use it for few more days and write again on my experience about this camera.\\n\\n\",\n",

Decent battery backup3. Live mode operation is not lagging.CONS1. While focusing the DSLR is making too much noise and its the kind of annoying that u will lose interest in taking photos.2. No shortcut or assigned button to change F stop (aperture). A manufacturer who is keeping dedicated button for changing the ISO have to thing about the importance of aperture.3. You can't change the focusing point by pressing the round dial in the system, if u press it some other setup will open up.4. The output image quality is actually not mind blowing.5. White balance- Use it if u want to take risk6. Main issue. If u use camera flash to snap a pic during focusing it will flicker like anything and it will annoy and irritate the subject7. Noise Noise Noise. Whatever low ISO you use noise will b there and when i went to service center to ask about this they were saying use a prime lens to get good output.I am a Nikon user i have Nikon D3400. I compared both cameras by taking same images with same settings in manual mode. The output from Nikon is better than Canon 1500D.In one word if want to push photography to next level from using a Point and Shoot or mobile camera to DSLR Or to learn the whole DSLR setting go for it (only with a mindset to change the camera in 1 or 2 years). As canon accessories are comparatively less costly than Nikon it wont create hole in ur pocket.I am not biased towards Nikon, i wrote wat i felt.Its not worth for money\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  Auto focus is not at all perfect.Minimum aperture is 4.5, so dont expect much in portrait.While focusing manually there is a play for the lense(18-55 mm) so that there is a chance for getting missing ur focus even though if ur made it correctly.Easy to operate compared to Nikkon models.Fast moving subjects cannot be captured as expected due to its poor auto focus performance. It take about 3 to 6 seconds to focus in internal lighting conditions and it fail to focus several times in dim lights.Plastic quality is poor.I got it for Rs.18599. So that it is a value for money product. Don't go for this model if ur willing to pay about 23k. Better go with Nikkon 5300.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  I have a mi security camera already and I am using it since one year. After the lockdown, it went out of stock but soon arrived at Amazon but it's cost had increased. Even then I went ahead and tried to purchase it as I had prior confidence but just before buying Amazon showed me a feature comparison with this camera (tapo c200). So my review would be largely a comparison of the two with a breakup of the features of both security cameras.On the feature front, this tapo camera beats mi security camera hands down. It comes with home monitoring, call/talk back feature just as mi security camera but additionally has privacy feature to switch off recording, alarm on/off on detection of movement, clean user interface, advanced self diagnosis feature, auto reboot feature and 128gb sdcard storage as against no privacy feature and 64gb in mi security camera. Also on detection of movement, mi security camera records multiple clips of max 1 min duration whereas tapo doesn't have that recording constraint. This is the biggest disadvantage of mi security camera. The setup took time as my WiFi was hidden and camera didn't recognize the hidden network even though I manually added it. But finally to overcome that, I made my WiFi network discoverable, once tapo recognized and stored it, I once again hid my WiFi and tapo didn't have any problem.Aesthetics of tapo are however not that good as mi security camera. mi security camera feels premium when touched physically. However when you touch tapo, you get a cheap Chinese feeling which I hated when I opened the box. Moreover tapo rotates from its bottom and the rotating diameter is large. Mi security camera rotates from its middle point and the rotating diameter is consequently smaller.Other than the rotating and aesthetics, tapo wins quite handsomely. If you want a premium feeling ( which no longer matters once the camera is setup) go for mi security camera otherwise go for tapo c200 and enjoy the rich features at a lesser price.Will update more about its longevity in future.Update1: After 3 months I realized that after inserting SD card, the initialisation time has increased by more than two minutes whereas in mi camera, the initialisation time hasn't noticeably changed. So mi camera wins here.Update 2: Recording and browsing of recording in sd card in tapo is better but when tapo records any video on detection of any Movement, the green light of the camera turns to red. Also when night mode switches on, one can hear the relay sound from tapo easily. Mi camera continues to emit blue light even while recording and no relay sound comes out of Mi camera when night mode switches on. So Mi camera wins here again.Update 3: in case of motion detection, mi camera takes an estimated 8-9 minutes to process the feed and send you a notification. That is, if a person/motion is detected at 8:00pm in front of camera, you will receive a notification only at 8:09 pm. In case of tapo, this is 4-5 minutes with a buzzer/alarm feature. Here Tapo wins down handsomely.More updates in future\\n\\n\",\n",

It loads instantly and delay is of few microseconds.I am using 1080p feed over RTSP and 360p feed on the app so both the things can be used at the same time.I have configured AI Face recognition using this camera to announce whoever is on my gate over my Google Home Mini and this is working really well with this cam.Pros:- Good Video Quality at 1080p and at Night- Really loud speaker- Camera Speaker can be used to trigger alarm sound- They offer RTSP/ONVIF support for these camera which is a big deal- Fast and Responsive App- Ability to live view camera feed on any computer systemCons:Sometimes connectivity issue in the app but it can be fixed with the update.No NAS support like Xiaomi Cameras, However I don't need it as RTSP is more then enough but having NAS support in app is a big bonus.\\n\\n\",\n",

It provides 360' degree tilting from left to right and vice versa, also up and down view is available.2) Clarity provides 1080 pixel, which you can't get in normal security camera especially at this budget(2500rs).3) It doesn't record the idle position, and captures any small movements. It only records if there is a movement, which is a good feature. Also it provides constant notification for every movement. Even it is a small flies it captures that too and sends the notification to mobile.4) You just need a wifi and power point.5) Draw back is if someone steals the camera, then you can't see anything, because everything is recorder in camera's sd card.Even if you switch off or it doesn't get wifi you can't view or download anything.6) if you are placing this inside the gate then it is a good option.7) another feature is it also records the voice.8) I inserted 128 gb sd card on this.My review is 5/5\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\n  Update 2: 3rd Oct 2021Cameras have got one or two firmware updates so far. Things have got better quite a bit now.Playback from app has improved.I am satisfied.I have installed the cameras on the walls outside. Away from direct sunlight and rain though. Covered openings with tape to prevent dust and moisture getting in.A year in, so far everything is fine.Update 1: The Tapo app absolutely sucks. Terrible app. Sometimes takes one or two minutes to get video from camera. Viewing recorded video footage is equally painful. You have to play the entire lenght of the video to record. Ridiculous! No option to simply get files from camera. Even trying to change camera settings is lethargic.----I will compare this camera with Mi Camera which I also own.C100 supports ONVIF and RTSP. It makes the camera versatile. You can connect it with software/hardware NVRs. I hooked it up with MotionEyeOS running on a Raspberry Pi.This was the reason why I bought this camera.You can see all RTSP/ONVIF IP cameras in grid view from a computer/Android TV.Mi cameras don't have ONVIF/RTSP support.Mi camera can only be viewed from a phone app. (And chromecast+google displays which most people don't have.)No PC software or even an Android TV app for Mi camera.You can connect it to a NAS where camera automatically uploads original recordings periodically. Tapo cameras don't have this. (You can create a NAS from your PC/RaspberryPi etc.)Tapo C100 over-saturates colors. Too much.Mi camera does it too but not that bad.Field of View of C100 is narrower than Mi camera.When Night Vision (infrared lights) is on in Tapo, three red LEDs can be seen with naked eye. It does not have invisible LED infrared. It makes the camera visible, which is bad.Tapo camera has two hooks on bottom to wall mount. Mi camera doesn't.Google assistant support is there for both cameras. You can cast camera to google home display/Chromecast ultra device.Build quality of Mi camera is better than Tapo C100.If you are only going to use a phone app to view the camera, get the Mi camera.If you need to see cameras on laptop, get Tapo.In case, in future Mi cameras get RTSP/ONVIF support, no doubt get Mi.\\n\\n\",\n",

The other two units worked flawlessly without any issues I faced with night mode. TP-Link's Tapo app was good with a clean UI with ability to view upto 32 cameras just like a cctv system.Pros:Easy setup, 128Gb storage, No SD errors like problems i faced in Mi cameras. Ability to connect the cameras to a NVR system as ONVIF protocol IP cameras.I added these cameras to my Synology DiskStation NAS system that has amazing surveillance station software that can beat any NVR systems available in india.Motion detection was too sensitive, had to reduce the sensitivity & muted the notifications on the phone.These are really good stable performing cameras. I can say these are very reliable for use as IP cameras.I'm currently using six Tapo C100 Cameras. No issues faced except for my first order. I'll be purchasing more & am planning to expand these upto 24 cameras. Waiting for the C310 outdoor camera to launch.October's end update: Using a total of 12 Tapo C100 & 2 Tapo C200 cameras with my Synology DS218+ DiskStation NAS system. Zero hiccups.

( 3k camera price+ installation charges + cabling and fitting material 400+ 2 k internet's charges as that require only broadband connection)but thinking that to go with camera even if failed this product it will loss only 1.5k ( half of branded Camera price)so I ordered this, initially when order was received i was disappointed by seem its damaged packaging. and box which has no seal.it was clearly identified that product must open before by someone, or used before..so almost decided to return.but then thought at least , should check its functionality.and I impressed thinking my purpose solved.its installation was so easy, and v380  app also so useful to guide and monitor camera.clarity is so good, audio also much better..taken one new sim of idea for my small router..which fluently working ( just 250₹ per month internet charges)it consumes hardly 200 mb per day...as it uses internet only when u access camera from remote places, ( much cheaper,,😊)also memory card installed, ( i forgot to count this cost above) this take only 1 or 1.5 gb per recording  of 12 hours ( SD view) , so if u go for 64gb  will back up of 1 month easily ( in my case i keep camera only for day time).remote playback also so clear and can control and watch each of comer of your home any where.yes..motion detection is useless as many reviewers answered this.so overall great item with this price.anyone with specific purpose can go for it..only 1 moth spend..lets hope for same working in future too..\\n\\n\",\n",

       " \"\\n\\n  I have been using the Mi 360° camera since a year and was satisfied with its performance. However, because of motion tracking, I went with Realme camera this time.Pros :1. Motion Tracking : It works quite well. The camera follows a normal walking person accurately.2. Microphone : The microphone on this one is absolutely better than the one on Mi. It records even low volume sounds.3. Physical Shutter : When you put the camera on sleep, a physical shutter rolls out covering the entire camera lens including the microphone. So, in terms of privacy, this feature is quite good and is missing in the Mi camera.4. Support for 128GB Memory Card : Unlike Mi 360° camera which supports upto 64GB only, this camera allows for upto 128GB memory cards which enables longer storage period of videos.5. Sound induced Recording : The Realme camera is able to start recording and send notifications in case of sound detection i.e., even if there is no motion but a signficant noise or sound is detected, then the camera will start recording and send you a notification on your mobile. This feature is missing in Mi.6. Fast Response : Compared to Mi, which takes a minute to record and send a notification to your mobile when a movement is detected, the Realme camera does the same within seconds. This is quite important because a thief may be able to power off the Mi 360° camera before it is able to send a notification but in case of Realme, it'll be difficult to do so.7. Encrypted Storage : The Realme camera encrypts the stored videos on memory card. This means the memory card is unreadable everywhere except from your Realme app. It also means that you cannot take out the memory card from the camera and view the recorded videos on your PC, laptop or mobile phone by inserting that memory card in those devices directly. This is a good privacy feature and is missing in the Mi camera.8. Hidden USB Power Port : In Realme camera, the USB Power Port is present in such a way that in order to remove the power cable, the camera needs to be first removed from the plastic holder. This may prevent a thief from easily switching off the camera. In case of Mi, the USB Power Port is right outside and is visible too, thus leaving the camera vulnerable to being powered off easily.Cons :1. Picture Quality : It leaves a lot to be desired. The picture (live view and recorded playback) has noticeable noise and looks grainy. I think in order to compress bandwidth, the Realme camera records videos at a low bitrate. Here, the Mi 360° camera wins as it has superior picture quality.2. Software : It is quite lacking in terms of features. First of all, the UI is confusing. Secondly, there is no option to quickly delete multiple recorded videos. Further, in order to view recorded videos, one has to seek the cursor exactly to the recorded timestamps otherwise the video doesn't play whereas in Mi, the nearest video to the seekbar gets automatically played. Hence, in software department, Mi is quite ahead.3. No Cloud Storage or NAS : Compared to Mi, the Realme camera offers no cloud storage or NAS. This means unless there is a memory card inserted, you won't be able to record videos. Further, if someone, say a thief, takes your camera with him, then you have nowhere to look for recordings (you may get a notification though).Apart from the above, the rest of the features are similar like Night Vision, Lens Distortion Correction, Switching off Camera Power LED, etc.So, in my opinion, if you have no issues with lesser storage and no motion tracking, then the Mi 360° camera is the best option. However, if those two features are important to you, then Realme camera will do the job just fine.\\n\\n\",\n",

       " '  i have a mi security camera already and i am using it since one year after the lockdown it went out of stock but soon arrived at amazon but its cost had increased even then i went ahead and tried to purchase it as i had prior confidence but just before buying amazon showed me a feature comparison with this camera tapo  so my review would be largely a comparison of the two with a breakup of the features of both security camerason the feature front this tapo camera beats mi security camera hands down it comes with home monitoring calltalk back feature just as mi security camera but additionally has privacy feature to switch off recording alarm onoff on detection of movement clean user interface advanced self diagnosis feature auto reboot feature and  sdcard storage as against no privacy feature and  in mi security camera also on detection of movement mi security camera records multiple clips of max  min duration whereas tapo doesnt have that recording constraint this is the biggest disadvantage of mi security camera the setup took time as my wifi was hidden and camera didnt recognize the hidden network even though i manually added it but finally to overcome that i made my wifi network discoverable once tapo recognized and stored it i once again hid my wifi and tapo didnt have any problemaesthetics of tapo are however not that good as mi security camera mi security camera feels premium when touched physically however when you touch tapo you get a cheap chinese feeling which i hated when i opened the box moreover tapo rotates from its bottom and the rotating diameter is large mi security camera rotates from its middle point and the rotating diameter is consequently smallerother than the rotating and aesthetics tapo wins quite handsomely if you want a premium feeling  which no longer matters once the camera is setup go for mi security camera otherwise go for tapo  and enjoy the rich features at a lesser pricewill update more about its longevity in  after  months i realized that after inserting sd card the initialisation time has increased by more than two minutes whereas in mi camera the initialisation time hasnt noticeably changed so mi camera wins hereupdate  recording and browsing of recording in sd card in tapo is better but when tapo records any video on detection of any movement the green light of the camera turns to red also when night mode switches on one can hear the relay sound from tapo easily mi camera continues to emit blue light even while recording and no relay sound comes out of mi camera when night mode switches on so mi camera wins here againupdate  in case of motion detection mi camera takes an estimated  minutes to process the feed and send you a notification that is if a personmotion is detected at  in front of camera you will receive a notification only at  pm in case of tapo this is  minutes with a buzzeralarm feature here tapo wins down handsomelymore updates in future',\n",

       " '  i have been using the mi ° camera since a year and was satisfied with its performance however because of motion tracking i went with realme camera this timepros  motion tracking  it works quite well the camera follows a normal walking person  microphone  the microphone on this one is absolutely better than the one on mi it records even low volume  physical shutter  when you put the camera on sleep a physical shutter rolls out covering the entire camera lens including the microphone so in terms of privacy this feature is quite good and is missing in the mi  support for  memory card  unlike mi ° camera which supports upto  only this camera allows for upto  memory cards which enables longer storage period of  sound induced recording  the realme camera is able to start recording and send notifications in case of sound detection ie even if there is no motion but a signficant noise or sound is detected then the camera will start recording and send you a notification on your mobile this feature is missing in  fast response  compared to mi which takes a minute to record and send a notification to your mobile when a movement is detected the realme camera does the same within seconds this is quite important because a thief may be able to power off the mi ° camera before it is able to send a notification but in case of realme itll be difficult to do  encrypted storage  the realme camera encrypts the stored videos on memory card this means the memory card is unreadable everywhere except from your realme app it also means that you cannot take out the memory card from the camera and view the recorded videos on your pc laptop or mobile phone by inserting that memory card in those devices directly this is a good privacy feature and is missing in the mi  hidden usb power port  in realme camera the usb power port is present in such a way that in order to remove the power cable the camera needs to be first removed from the plastic holder this may prevent a thief from easily switching off the camera in case of mi the usb power port is right outside and is visible too thus leaving the camera vulnerable to being powered off easilycons  picture quality  it leaves a lot to be desired the picture live view and recorded playback has noticeable noise and looks grainy i think in order to compress bandwidth the realme camera records videos at a low bitrate here the mi ° camera wins as it has superior picture  software  it is quite lacking in terms of features first of all the ui is confusing secondly there is no option to quickly delete multiple recorded videos further in order to view recorded videos one has to seek the cursor exactly to the recorded timestamps otherwise the video doesnt play whereas in mi the nearest video to the seekbar gets automatically played hence in software department mi is quite  no cloud storage or nas  compared to mi the realme camera offers no cloud storage or nas this means unless there is a memory card inserted you wont be able to record videos further if someone say a thief takes your camera with him then you have nowhere to look for recordings you may get a notification thoughapart from the above the rest of the features are similar like night vision lens distortion correction switching off camera power led etcso in my opinion if you have no issues with lesser storage and no motion tracking then the mi ° camera is the best option however if those two features are important to you then realme camera will do the job just fine',\n",
